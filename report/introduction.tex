    On October 2, 2006 Netflix announced the start of the so called \enquote{Netflix Prize} competition.
    It was aimed to find the best algorithm for collaborative filtering to predict user ratings for movies based on previous ratings without any other information about the users or the movies.
    Three years later on September 18, 2009 Netflix announced the winner of the Grand Prize which has beaten the current algorithm \enquote{Cinematch} Netflix already used by over 10\% of error rate.
    The solution of the winner-team \enquote{BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos} was based on \cite{Hinton2007} and therefore used a special implementation of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM).
    The competition has shown that RBMs build a state-of-the-art tool for collaborative filtering.

    RBMs have also found their application in other machine learning topics as well.
    For example, in dimensionality reduction, classification and topic modelling.
    Due to their basic structure, good properties and fast learning algorithms they are used as basic building blocks in deep neural networks, for example in deep belief networks.
