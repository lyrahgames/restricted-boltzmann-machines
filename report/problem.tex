        The table shows examples of binary ratings for movies made by some imaginary users.
        Every row represents a user and every column a movie.
        The number $0$ is used to point out that the user does not like the movie and $1$ for the opposite.
        The symbol $\times$ is used if there was no rating for the movie by this user.

    Collaborative filtering as seen in a modern narrow sense basically can be described as a method to make automatic predictions about interests of users by collecting the preferences or tastes of many users.
    The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.

    To understand the statement of the problem we will use the prediction of movie ratings as done for the \enquote{Netflix Prize} competition.
    In table \ref{tab:problem-example} one can see some examples for these ratings.
    The entries with $0$ and $1$ are already known and shall be used to predict the unknown values with $\times$.
    In the example the users \enquote{James T. Kirk} and \enquote{Thorin Oakenshield} both like the movies \enquote{Star Trek} and \enquote{The Matrix}.
    So one could assume that the user \enquote{James T. Kirk} likes the movie \enquote{Van Helsing} and that the user \enquote{Thorin Oakenshield} does not like the movie \enquote{Harry Potter}.

    The abstract goals to achieve this can be described as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Approximately represent probability distributions over ratings
      \item Learn a probability distribution based on some given ratings.
      \item Make predictions for unrated movies for learned parameters.
    \end{itemize}
